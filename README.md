Small apps and scripts

## [txtAppender.py] (/txtAppender.py)
Good if you need to combine files in a folder with filenames "filename.txt" and "filename (1).txt"
Takes folder path as input. The script cycles through the all files in the source directory, then creates a new file for every two files and places it in a new folder at orginalDirectory\comb
Prompts user for preferred naming pattern based on two original files.
